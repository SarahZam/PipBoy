# PipBoy
I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap 4 in quarantine and decided to make a web page for Pipboy from fallout 4!! It's still a work in progress but I'm proud of how it looks!

The css file contains a lot of bootstrap files. You guys can ignore that since i imported bootstrap from the net. Same for the js file. The main files are pipboy.app.css and pipboy.add.js
